# Polynomial Advanced Language (PAL)

---------------------------

## Description

The main purpose and focus for __Polynomial Advanced Language (PAL)__ is to facilitate different complex functions of polynomials, as well as functionalities that a normal language can perform and basic or advanced mathematical operations. This language will help many people who do not have the time to perform complex polynomial functions for some job, project, or research. On the other hand, the user will feel comfortable with the language since the syntax is as simple as possible and easy to learn without requiring much time using it. In addition, it could be beneficial for students, low-income people and to avoid spending money on books or calculators that would do the same functionality.
